# Java is not a "PURE" Object-Oriented Language <hr>
  because it uses primitive data types such as 
  (int,float,char...etc). The developers of 
  java could have made these primitive data 
  types as objects(like String... etc), 
  but the primitive data types such as 
  int float... are more faster than objects!

# Java is Platform Independent programming Language

# But Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is platform Dependent.
# <hr>

JVM is platform dependent because it takes java byte code and generates byte code for the current operating system.
So Java software is platform dependent but Java language is platform independent because different operating system 
have different JVMs.
# java code or .class file is platform Independent
